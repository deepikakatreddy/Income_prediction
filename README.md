# Income Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on various attributes.

## Project Structure

- **import_libraries.py**: Imports necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and model building.
- **load_data.py**: Loads the dataset and displays the first few records.
- **data_exploration.py**: Explores the data through visualizations such as heatmaps and count plots.
- **data_cleaning.py**: Cleans the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables.
- **train_test_split.py**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets and scales the features.
- **model_training.py**: Trains various classification models and evaluates their performance.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```
3. Run each script in the specified order to process the data and train the models:
    ```bash
    python import_libraries.py
    python load_data.py
    python data_exploration.py
    python data_cleaning.py
    python train_test_split.py
    python model_training.py
    ```

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates how to build and evaluate machine learning models for income prediction. Various models are compared to determine which performs best on the given dataset.
